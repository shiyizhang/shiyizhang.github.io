 Testing for paragraph . 

Hi there! 

Hi there! This is going to be my first post here ever! There is still a lot of work to be done on this site. But,one step a day. 

I'm planing to have these six part on this website. 

1) coding part
        ( Code that I write that day, mistakes I made, what sources I use, did that work? and why?) 
2) fooide part :) 
3) Chinese culture/ Asian culture 
4) EE part
5) language study part
6) algorithms/ interview practice 
7) 30 days challenge (hopefully I can add feature for check in everyday.)

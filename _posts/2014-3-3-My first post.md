 Testing for paragraph . 

Hi there! 

Hi there! This is going to be my first post here ever! There is still a lot of work to be done on this site. But,one step a day. 

I'm planing to have these six part on this website. 

- coding part
 ( Code that I write that day, mistakes I made, what sources I use, did that work? and why?) 
- fooide part :) 
- Chinese culture/ Asian culture 
- EE part
- language study part
- algorithms/ interview practice 
- 30 days challenge (hopefully I can add feature for check in everyday.)

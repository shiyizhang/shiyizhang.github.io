title: Working on my website
---

I need to put more time into coding and studying. I wish I could have 30 hours per day. 

things I need to do tomorrow: 

1. complete at least one section of DevTips website building video (1.5hour)
2. complete the reaction game (30mins)
3. start learning JavaScript ( 30mins) 
4. review hashmap and write a summary about it, post it here too (1.5 hour)
5. call writing center, see if they can check my blog grammar?(10mins) 
6. finish semincondcotr homework(2 hours)
7. stas homework. (1.5hours)
8. review for stas (1hour) 


Base on this schedule, I need to start working at 6:00am, and it's 2 am now, I'm still at school. Obviously, I'm doing something wrong. I need to be more productive, and plan things better. 


On the other hand, I start understanding the construction behind jekyll more, same with Android Studio. I'm getting better with using terminal and commend line. Which is good,but still not good enough. 

Reminder: 
here are the stuffs I need to complete by the end of Feb or mid March:
* finish Udemy web development class,( section 4, 10, 11 .... and finish the assignment.) by the end of this month
* upload these on github website ( by the end of this month) 
* finish Andriod development class, and publish 1 app in the app store. ( by the mid of feb, and publish - mid march)
* finish reviewing hashmap, tree, linklist ( mid March)
